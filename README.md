# SIFTORA

## 💄 Project Description

SIFTORA provides a convenient way for users to keep a digital inventory of all their makeup and skincare products. Products are organized into user-named "bins" and can be sorted by a variety of fields, including price, expiry date, and product use.

## 🗺 Planning

User stories
As a user, I want to add a product to more than one bin so that I can have an all-inclusive bin and a bin for when I travel.
As a user, I want to sort products by property so that I can see what products are expiring soon or what brands I tend to purchase from.
As a user, I want to add multiple photos for a product so that I can reference my photos of swatches in different lighting.

## 👩‍💻 Technologies

This frontend React application utilizes JSX, React-Bootstrap, React Router, as well as Axios (for fetching data).
