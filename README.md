# SIFTORA

## 💄 Project Description

SIFTORA provides a convenient way for users to keep a digital inventory of all their makeup and skincare products. Products are organized into user-named "bins" and can be sorted by a variety of fields, including price, expiry date, and product use.

## 🗺 Planning

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to add a product to more than one bin so that I can have an all-inclusive bin and a bin for when I travel.
- As a user, I want to sort products by field so that I can see what products are expiring soon or what brands I tend to purchase from.
- As a user, I want to add photos so that I can easily reference them when I am deciding on a shade in store.
